## Bullshit

### Assignment

I got a seven on the Bullshit assignment.

## Data gathering

### Kinect_CSV
I programmed a piece of the kinect recording software to be able to output CSVs. This is because CSVs are much easier to work with than xml files.

### Programmer guidelines

In the beginning I set up guidelines on how we're going to go about programming our programs.
This is now written in their respective repositories' readme files. 
This is mainly about how we are allowed to make changes to programs and include such requirements as code reviews.

## Data manipulation

### CSV Combinator
I created a python package that can combine a folder of folders of Kinect data to a single csv. This is much easier to work with than having hundreds of seperate CSV files.

### Pepper train

With Boris I designed the process on how a 'train' could be made to work. This combines many steps of data manipulation to raw kinect data. Afterwards I build this into a python package [Here](https://github.com/KinectingPepper/pepper_train)

### Packagize other code

Because most people were making their code in jupyter, it was hard to work with this and almost impossible to do some version management on it. 
I made the jupyter files into Python packages that should be easily installable with pip.

Sadly, due to serverside user-rights issues and usability concerning people's inexperience with working outside python, these are not able to be used at the moment in jupyter.
