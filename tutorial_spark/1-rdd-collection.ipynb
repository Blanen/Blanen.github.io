Since they are immutable, every tranformation can be seen as an operation that generates a new RDD and action as an operation that generates a result. \n",

Designed to make large data sets processing even easier, DataFrame allows developers to impose a structure onto a distributed collection of data, allowing higher-level abstraction\n",
